        "answer": "Avatar Toolkit offers several configuration options to customize its behavior:\n\n1) Language Settings\n- Located at the top of the Settings panel\n- Allows you to change the interface language\n- Changes take effect after restarting Blender\n[image:800:400]https://cdn.neoneko.xyz/avatartoolkit/wiki/settings/language.png[/image]\n\n2) Armature Validation Mode\nControls how strictly Avatar Toolkit validates armatures:\n- Strict Mode: Enforces full hierarchy checking and symmetry validation\n- Basic Mode: Only checks for essential bones (hips, spine, chest, neck, head)\n- None: Disables validation checks\n[image:800:400]https://cdn.neoneko.xyz/avatartoolkit/wiki/settings/validation.png[/image]\n\n3) Debug Settings\n- Enable Logging: Activates detailed operation logging for troubleshooting\n- Useful for reporting issues or understanding tool operations\n[image:800:400]https://cdn.neoneko.xyz/avatartoolkit/wiki/settings/debug.png[/image]\n\n4) Quick Access Panel\n- Select your armature from the dropdown\n- Shows validation status and bone count\n- Indicates if pose bones are available\n[image:800:400]https://cdn.neoneko.xyz/avatartoolkit/wiki/settings/quickaccess.png[/image]\n\n[note]The validation mode setting is particularly important when working with non-standard armatures. Use 'Basic' or 'None' if your armature doesn't follow typical humanoid conventions.[/note]\n\n[info]Settings are automatically saved and persisted between Blender sessions.[/info]",
