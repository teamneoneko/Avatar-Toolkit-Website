            "question": "How does the Material Combination System work?",
            "answer": "The material combination system intelligently merges similar materials to improve performance:\n\n### Material Detection\n- Analyzes all materials across meshes\n- Identifies materials with matching properties:\n  - Color values\n  - Texture assignments\n  - Shader settings\n  - Alpha properties\n\n### Combination Process\n- Preserves original material qualities\n- Merges identical textures\n- Consolidates similar material settings\n- Maintains UV mapping integrity\n\n### Cleanup Process\n- Removes unused material slots\n- Cleans up duplicate textures\n- Optimizes material assignments\n- Updates mesh references\n\n[info]This process can significantly reduce draw calls and improve performance.[/info]\n\n[note]The system preserves visual appearance while reducing material count.[/note]",

            "answer": "The mesh join system offers two powerful methods for combining meshes:\n\n### Join All Meshes\n- Combines all avatar meshes into one\n- Preserves all material assignments\n- Maintains vertex groups\n- Optimizes UV maps\n- Fixes mesh orientation\n\n### Join Selected Meshes\n- Combines only chosen meshes\n- Perfect for partial optimization\n- Maintains mesh properties\n- Preserves armature relationships\n\n### Automatic Optimizations\n- Fixes overlapping UVs\n- Maintains shape keys\n- Preserves vertex weights\n- Handles material slots\n\n[warning]Joining meshes is a permanent operation. Make a backup before proceeding.[/warning]\n\n[note]Joined meshes often perform better in-game due to reduced draw calls.[/note]",
